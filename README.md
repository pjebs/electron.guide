# Tutorial: How to create a Cross-platform Desktop App using Electron, Go and React

![Electron + Go + React](https://github.com/rocketlaunchr/desktop-application/blob/tutorial/go-react-electron.png?raw=true)


## Introduction

With [GopherJS](https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs) [a Go-to-JavaScript transpiler] and the power which [ElectronJS](https://electronjs.org/) possesses, Go Developers can now create cross-platform Desktop apps written 100% in GoLang.

Before we start off, sidebar:
1. This tutorial is targeted at Go Developers who either have little to no prior or professional knowledge of [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), [RollupJS](https://rollupjs.org/) or [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager).
2. You should have a professional knowledge of GoLang.
3. You'll need have some chill and enthusiasm. :)


## What we'll be building: A Mark-down App

In this tutorial, we'll be building a (cross-platform) Mark-down App. See this [repository](https://github.com/rocketlaunchr/desktop-application/) for full source code.

To have a look and feel of our Markdown app, clone the repo locally with:

```
git clone https://github.com/rocketlaunchr/desktop-application.git
```

then run `npm start` in the cloned directory from a CLI (Command Line Interface).

On app start, a tray icon should be displayed somewhere at the top of your screen (if you're on Mac) or at the bottom-right of your screen (on the taskbar) on Windows; click on the icon to view app.
